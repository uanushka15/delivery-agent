# Autonomous Delivery Agent System

## Overview

This is an autonomous delivery agent system that operates in a 2D grid-based environment. The system implements multiple pathfinding algorithms (BFS, UCS, A*, Hill Climbing) to navigate through grid worlds with obstacles, varying terrain costs, and dynamic elements. The agent can handle package pickup and delivery tasks while optimizing for different constraints like time and fuel limits.

The system provides comprehensive testing capabilities through predefined maps of varying complexity, performance visualization tools, and a command-line interface for algorithm comparison and demonstration.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

**Agent Architecture**: The system uses a state-based delivery agent (`DeliveryAgent`) that can be in different states (idle, moving, collecting, delivering, replanning). The agent carries packages and makes rational decisions about pickup and delivery sequences. A `MultiAlgorithmAgent` extends this to dynamically switch between pathfinding algorithms based on environmental conditions.

**Environment Model**: The grid environment (`GridEnvironment`) represents a 2D city with different cell types (empty, obstacle, start, goal, agent, package) and varying terrain costs. The environment supports dynamic elements like moving obstacles that change position over time, making pathfinding more challenging.

**Algorithm Framework**: The pathfinding system uses an abstract base class (`PathfindingAlgorithm`) with concrete implementations for BFS, Uniform Cost Search, A*, and Hill Climbing. Each algorithm returns detailed search results including path, cost, nodes expanded, and execution time for performance analysis.

**Task Management**: The system defines packages with pickup/delivery locations and priorities, and delivery tasks that can include multiple packages with constraints like time limits and fuel limits.

### Design Patterns

**Strategy Pattern**: Different pathfinding algorithms can be swapped dynamically through the common interface, allowing the agent to choose the best algorithm based on current conditions.

**State Machine**: The agent uses clear state transitions (idle → moving → collecting → delivering) to manage complex delivery workflows.

**Factory Pattern**: Test maps are created through factory functions that generate different complexity scenarios (small, medium, large, dynamic).

### Data Flow

The system follows a clear separation of concerns: the environment provides the world model, algorithms handle pathfinding logic, the agent manages high-level decision making, and visualization components handle display and analysis. Search results are standardized across all algorithms for consistent performance comparison.

## External Dependencies

**Matplotlib**: Used for visualization of grid environments, pathfinding results, and performance comparisons. Provides 2D plotting capabilities for displaying maps, paths, and analytical charts.

**NumPy**: Handles numerical operations and array manipulations for efficient grid processing and color mapping in visualizations.

**Standard Library**: 
- `heapq` for priority queue operations in pathfinding algorithms
- `json` for loading and saving map configurations
- `argparse` for command-line interface
- `dataclasses` and `enum` for structured data representation
- `abc` for abstract base classes
- `typing` for type hints and better code documentation

The system is designed to be self-contained with minimal external dependencies, focusing on core pathfinding and delivery logic rather than complex integrations.
